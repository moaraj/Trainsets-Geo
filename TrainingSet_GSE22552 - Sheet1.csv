GSE22552;Homo sapiens;GSM559689;CFU-E_1;Yes;Pert;A;1;PBMC-derived erythroblasts grown in vitro were harvested at the CFU-E, Pro-E, Int-E and Late-E stages and FACS sorted based on expression of cell surface markers. RNA was extracted from those populations which met rigorous specifications of time cultured in the presence of erythropoietin, morphology and CD36, CD71 and CD235a expression. For each stage, 3 chips were hybridised, each representing a pool of 4 different samples. In addition to these 12 chips, one chip representing a pool of RNA extracted from unsorted cells at each stages was also hybridised.
