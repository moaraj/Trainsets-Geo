GSE5457;Homo sapiens;GSM124905;A549_rep1;No;Cont;A;1;EBV infected cells and A549 were cultured in RPMI1640+5%FCS, and exposed to 10ng/ml TGF beta1 for 4hours. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription and microarray analysis were performed as previously reported (Kieran et al., 2003). All analysis were microarrayed in duplicate. Image files were obtained through Affymetrix GeneChip software (MAS5), subsequently robust multichip analysis (RMA) was performed. Expression data were compared to control, p<0.05 correlated values and a signal log ratio of 0.6 or greater (equivalent to a fold change in expression of 1.5 or greater) were taken to identify significant differential regulation (Bolstad et al., 2003). All the SLRs data resulting from the comparative analyses in duplicate were reported in a scatter plot graph to determine the reliability of the assay and the linearity by r2. For all the microarray assays r2 value was higher than 0.98. Using normalised RMA values by Gene Cluster Software, Average Linkage Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed using TreeView analysis software (Eisen et al., 1998). Lists of dysregulated genes in both TGF?1 exposed cell lines were curated via the publicly available DAVID, Gene-Ontology (GOCharts) and Functional Annotation Clustering databases (Dennis et al., 2003).
