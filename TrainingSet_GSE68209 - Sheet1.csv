GSE68209;Homo sapiens;GSM1665813;GSK-treated MOLM-14 cells, rep1;No;Pert;A;1;AMPK activation by GSK621 induces cell death in acute myeloid leukemia. Surprisingly, we found that mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin protects cells against GSK621-induced cytotoxicity. A genome-wide gene expression assay was performed to understand the molecular basis of this phenotype.
