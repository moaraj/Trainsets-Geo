GSE70955;Homo sapiens;GSM1824036;Embryonic stem cell, biological rep1;No;Pert;A;1;Human embryonic stem cell were differentiated to skeletal muscle and compared to non-differentiated cells in triplicate biological replicates. For the confirmation of differentiated cell's characteristics and the global mRNA profiles, We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Further more, we used microarrys for the comparing control and disease gene expression profiles, again in triplicate.
