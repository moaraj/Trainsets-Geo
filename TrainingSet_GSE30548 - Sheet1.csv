GSE30543;Homo sapiens;GSM757755;SUM149_siControl_rep1;N;Cont;A;0;SUM149 cells transiently transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting TIG1 were used. Total RNA was extracted and purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The integrity of the obtained RNA was assessed using an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The Affymetrix HGU133 plus platform was used for hybridization, staining, and imaging of the arrays by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression analysis was performed in triplicate.
