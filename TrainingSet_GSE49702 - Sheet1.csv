GSE49702;Homo sapiens;GSM1205158;B.CD4+RO+TCRab+RH123+#1;No;Pert;A;1;Human mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of a healthy adult donor (Ficol density centrifugation) or from resected lesioned gut tissue of a patient with active Crohn's disease. For cell isolation from gut tissue, tissue was rinsed with PBS, treated with 0.15% DTT to remove mucous, then with 1 mM EDTA to remove epithelial cells and intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Remaining tissue was digested using Liberase-TL (Roche) plus 10 U/mL DNase I. Mononuclear cells were then filtered through 70 mM nylon filters and isolated via a 30%/ 70% Percol gradient. Mononuclear cells from blood or gut tissue were FACS-sorted into CD3+ CD4+ CD45RO+ MDR1+ or MDR1- memory T cells, using Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux as a surrogate for MDR1 expression/ activity. Sorted cells were harvested directly ex vivo (without further in vitro culture or manipulation) prior to RNA extraction.
