GSE14011;Homo sapiens;GSM351746;H929 myeloma cells-treated_DMSO_4h;No;Cont;A;1;H929 and U266 human myeloma cell lines were treated with pristimerin 500nM (~2x IC50) or DMSO vehicle and harvested at 4h, prior to the appearance of any macroscopic evidence of perturbed viability. RNA was isolated using Trizol, column purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and hybridized to Hg_U133_plus_2 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Probe-set signal intensities were PLIER16-normalized using Affymetrix Expression Console software and flagged using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5 (MAS5) Present/Absent/Marginal detection calls. Expression data was analyzed with GeneSpring 7 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA) software, with drug-treated samples normalized per cell line to DMSO-treated controls. Gene lists were filtered to exclude non-expressed probe-sets with MAS5 ‘Absent’ detection calls across all samples tested (treated and untreated). Probe-sets upregulated or suppressed by pristimerin in each cell line were delineated by volcano plot filter (>1.5 fold change, FDR<0.25) and the Venn intersection of probe-sets modulated by drug in both cell lines was used in deriving a pristimerin signature.
